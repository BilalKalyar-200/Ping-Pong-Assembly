# Assembly Pong Game

## Overview
This project is a classic **Pong Game** written in x86 Assembly language using the **NASM assembler**. It is a two-player game that demonstrates advanced assembly programming concepts like keyboard interrupt handling, real-time input, graphics rendering, and sound generation.

The game includes features such as:
- Paddle movement controlled by keyboard input.
- Real-time ball physics with collision detection.
- Visualized scores and game layout.

## Features
